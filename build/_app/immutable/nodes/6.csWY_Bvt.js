It moved to Bremerton, in
	1958. In 1929, exhibitors at the Fair totaled 1,000; today there are more than 6,000, with an
	annual attendance of over 80,000. <br/> In 1960, the Chief Kitsap Stampede sold stock certificates for $1 and constructed the Thunderbird Arena.
	When completed, it held 12,000 spectators. In the late ‘70’s, portions of the Arena were condemned.
	The covered grandstands were later added. Today the Arena holds 5,000 spectators and is used year-round
	for various events such as the Demolition Derby, Draft Horse Show, monster trucks, and more. The complex
	has an annual overall attendance at its various events of more than 211,000. <br/> ​ In January 2020, the The Kitsap Fair and Stampede Association was formed to take over the responsibility
	of producing the annual Kitsap Fair and Rodeo. The non-profit organization is governed by 11 appointed
	board members. They come with a variety of experience in business, public service and public involvement. <br/> Unfortunately, the 2020 fair was cancelled due to the COVID-19 virus. In 2023, the Fair and Rodeo
	celebrated the 100th Kitsap Fair. ​In 2024, the Kitsap Stampede celebrated 75 years of rodeo in
	the county.</p> <h3>MISSION STATEMENT:</h3> <p>The mission of the Kitsap Fair & Stampede is to provide entertainment and educational events that
	are fun, safe, innovative; yet preserves tradition for the benefit of the greater west sound area.
	​</p> <h3>VISION:</h3> <p>A thriving, premier organization that is successful, self-sufficient, and respected by all.</p> <h3>VALUES:</h3> <p>KFSA foundation values are honesty, professionalism, respect, effectiveness and efficiency
	delivered through exceptional customer service, teamwork and common goals.</p>`,1);function h(e){var i=o();r(36),t(e,i)}export{h as component};
